# Introduction to Machine Learning

First step is creating spectrograms from the audio files. For the spectrogram creation, please refer to ML.ipynb.

## Data Preprocessing

Noise reduction silence cutting has been done while creating spectrograms. Other preprocessing for our experiments can be found in 'Plotting Spectograms for Training & Research'
For our final model we have used our experiment that spectrograms that had more than 95% similarity has been erased. For those tests please refer to 'Comparison Scripts'

We had an experiment with comparing scripts that can be found at 'Counting Words'

## Model

For model creation please refer to ML.ipynb 

## Results
For results and Models please refer to folder 'Models'

## Extra Tasks

Please refer to "resnet18_layer_eval_analysis.py" and "resnet18_parameter_space_analysis.py" Pruning mentioned in the jupyter notebook
