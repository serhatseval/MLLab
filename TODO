2. Simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (1 Point)
Basic data exploration:
Visualize some spectrograms to understand the data distribution between Class 1 and Class 0 (permitted vs. non-permitted people).
Analyze the duration, amplitude, and frequency patterns of different speakers.
Check for potential issues:
Identify missing or noisy data.
Look into class imbalance (as there are fewer Class 1 samples than Class 0).
Try visualizing data distributions, such as speaker statistics (e.g., gender, pitch, etc.).
3. Creating a Simple Network and Training (1 Point)
Model architecture:
Start with a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. You can follow an existing tutorial such as the CIFAR-10 tutorial (PyTorch link provided in your project).
Adapt this CNN to handle the spectrogram input. Ensure the input shape matches the shape of your spectrograms.
Training setup:
Use a simple loss function like binary cross-entropy for this binary classification task.
Train the model using a small subset of your data and aim for an initial F1 score of at least 0.6 on the training data.
Store the trained model and ensure reproducibility of the code.
